AI coding/usage policy:
AI generated code is forbidden in the project core, it is only allowed in the periphery
(i.e. dependent features that are useless without the core, esp. code implementing supporting/convenience features).

The reason are two issues with AI generated code:
- generated code could be a copyright/license-breach of existing code from other projects published under stricter licenses like GPL
- the GrGen-core should be under LGPL-license, so that improvements have to be published/returned back (this requires human authorship)

In detail/what is considered to be the project core:

AI generated code is forbidden in:
- the implementation of the model, rule/computations, and embedded control languages, i.e. in the compiler
- the implementation of the control language, i.e. in the sequences interpreter
- the implementation of the existing shell-language-constructs, i.e. in the GrShell interpreter
  (a base execution environment for file mapping should be available as LGPL version,
   the some holds for base debugging support with console printing)
- in the interface and supporting code for basic graph visualization (the mapping to a graph viewer library or app)

AI generated code is allowed for:
- all GUI features on top of the basic graph visualization,
  esp. GUI-debugging-features visualizing the model, rules, and sequences (and similar debugging visualizations/development support)
- new shell features (that are not strictly required to use the core or extensions of the other languages)

Consequences / specific rules: 
- AI generated code must be contained in separate files
  so required code in existing non-AI files must be supplied by a human programmer
  so refactorings changing non-AI code are not allowed by AI bots
- if you are concerned about the first issue with AI generated code mentioned at the top of the file,
  you should keep your hands of using the GUI debugger or the libGrShell (at least dedicated features) at API level

This is a quite strict policy which could be changed/relaxed in the future upon legal clarifications/changes.
(What's the difference between an AI agent refactoring and a normal IDE refactoring? Or AI-based vs non-AI auto-completions/wizards? Interactive helpers instead of full-scope generation from specification?)
(AI generated code is likely to be considered to be in the public domain, similar to the SQLite used in implementing the persistent graph, or the code generated by the parser generators, or the code generated by GrGen itself.)
(An option for e.g. new shell features stemming from vibe coding that are later on considered essential could be a follow-up implementation by a human programmer replacing it.)

Regarding the user manual:
- AI generated content is forbidden
- AI corrections are allowed
(What's the difference between AI proofreading compared to a regular spell checker?)
