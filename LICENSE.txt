Remarks/Refinements:
Free programmers: since about 2010 nearly all contributions are from programmers outside of the original university institute.

Intended use: you can freely _use_ GrGen.NET without publishing your code
- the generated code is yours, besides it you must only link against some DLLs, esp. libGr.dll and lgspBackend.dll at runtime,
which is admissible under LGPL, but when you extend the supplied code you must share your changes.

--------

The graph viewer yComp (yComp.jar, which is, for your convenience, part of the release is closed source and free for academic use only.
You are esp. not allowed to ship it with a release of your own commercial software, in contrast to the GrGen libraries.

To be more specific, see also https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/firm/yComp.html:
This software is based on the yFiles library.
yWorks GmbH granted an academic license for „yFiles“ to IPD Goos: An academic license restricts the use of the software (yComp)
to non-commercial purposes (research, teaching, projects, courses and application development).

(This includes yObf.jar, graphmlObf.jar, ysvgObf.jar; the yFiles version according to the about dialog is 2.6.0.1)

Regarding batik.jar likely from the apache xmlgraphics batik project used in yComp for svg functionality:
the Apache License Version 2.0 holds, see batik.txt.

--------

Regarding the MSAGL (Microsoft Automatic Graph Layout library) the following holds:
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. 
It is available under an MIT License, see the MIT_of_MSAGL.txt in the licenses folder.

--------

Graph persistence is implemented using SQLite.
The code and documentation in System.Data.SQLite as well as SQLite proper have been dedicated to the public domain.
The System.Data.SQLite.Linq and System.Data.SQLite.EF6 assemblies are compiled from files covered by the Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)
- but they are not used in implementing graph persistence.

--------

Regarding the ANTLR binaries a BSD-like license holds, see ANTLR3.txt.
 (The ANTLR 3.4 runtimes are needed when using grgen.jar, i.e. the GrGen compiler frontend,
  ANTLR 3.4 complete is needed when building grgen.jar,
  ANTLR 3.1.1 is needed by yComp.)

Regarding jargs.jar used in grgen.jar for parsing the command line arguments a BSD-like license holds,
see jargs.txt (likely a bit too current, the build is from 2003-03-11).

--------

Regarding the CSharpCC binary (likely a home-brew version of MinosseCC described at https://www.codeproject.com/articles/MinosseCC-a-lexer-parser-generator-for-C-#comments-section)
most likely a BSD-like license holds, see CSharpCC.txt and JavaCC.txt (the build is from 2008-03-10).
 (CSharpCC is only needed when building GrGen.NET itself (for the shell parser, the sequences parser, a constant literals parser).)
