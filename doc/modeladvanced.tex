\label{cha:modeladvanced}

In addition to the key features of the \emph{graph models}\indexmain{graph model} of \GrG\ as already described in Chapter~\ref{chapmodellang}, you may specify \emph{methods} in the node or edge classes.
Methods are functions or procedures that are declared inside class scope.
In contrast to attributes that do not support overwriting -- each attribute of a type is added to all subtypes, with multiple declarations being forbidden -- methods support overwriting.
Independent of the statically known type of the variable, the method gets executed that was defined nearest to the exact dynamic type of the value, in case a method is called.

This \emph{dynamic dispatch} is the defining feature of object-oriented programming.
For graph-oriented programming, the defining feature is \emph{pattern-matching}.
Graph-oriented programming can be made scalable to large tasks with hierarchically \emph{nested graphs}, allowed for by attributes of graph type in the model, implemented with switch-to-subgraph and return-from-subgraph operations.

\begin{rail}
  AdvancedModelDeclarations: () + (FunctionMethodDefinition
										 | ProcedureMethodDefinition
  									 | ExternalClassDeclaration
  									 | ExternalFunctionDeclaration
  									 | EmitParseDeclaration
  									 | CopyCompareDeclaration
										 | PackageDefinitionModel
										 | EqualsAnyParallelization);
\end{rail}\ixnterm{AdvancedModelDeclarations}

The \emph{ExternalClassDeclaration} registers an \indexed{external class} with \GrG -- including its subtype hierarchy, excluding any attributes -- which can be used subsequently in attribute computations in \indexed{external function}s.
The \emph{EmitParseDeclaration} declares that the user defines emit and parse functions for external or object type values,
whereas the \emph{CopyCompareDeclaration} declares that the user defines copy and compare functions for external or object type values.
You find more on them in \ref{chapextensions}, here we will take a closer look on the \emph{FunctionMethodDefinition} and \emph{ProcedureMethodDefinition}, followed by the \emph{PackageDefinitionModel}.
The \emph{EqualsAnyParallelization} is explained in \ref{sec:performanceparallel}.
%Node/Edge typed attributes are possible.

\section{Methods}\label{sec:objectoriented}

Computations on attributes of node or edge types that are occurring frequently may be factored out into a method definition given inside a class definition of the model file.
Such compound computations can be built and abstracted into reusable entities in two different forms, \emph{function methods} usable(/callable) from expression context, and \emph{procedure methods} usable(/callable) from statement context.
Besides, some built-in function methods and procedure methods on container types are available in rule language computations and sequence computations, cf. \ref{cha:container};
in addition to the methods defined in \ref{cha:typeexpr} that are only available in the rule language.
%(Furthermore, external functions methods and computation methods may be declared, callable with the same syntax, too.)

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Function Method Definition and Call}\label{sub:functionmethods}\label{sec:funcmethcall} 

Function methods are defined in exactly the same way as a function is defined, just inside the hosting class.
They have the same requrirements, 
i.e. exactly one output value must be returned, 
and they must be side-effect free, which especially means that they are not allowed to change the attributes of their hosting type.

\begin{rail} 
  FunctionMethodDefinition: FunctionDefinition;
\end{rail}\ixnterm{FunctionMethodDefinition}

\begin{rail}
  FunctionMethodCall: (Variable | Variable '.' Attribute) '.' Name '(' (Expression * ',') ')' ;
\end{rail}\ixnterm{FunctionMethodCall}

A such defined function method may then be called as an expression atom from anywhere in the rule language file where an expression is required; or even from the sequence computations where an expression is required.
The built-in function methods listed in \ref{funcmethstab} are called with the same syntax.

Inside the function methods, the special entity \texttt{this} is available.
It allows to access the attributes and methods of the type the method is contained in.
In contrast to Java, C++, or C\# where \texttt{this} may be used optionally to denote member or method access,
the usage of \texttt{this} is mandatory in \GrG~in order to access the attributes of the type or call the methods of the type.

\subsection{Procedure Method Definition And Call}\label{sub:proceduremethods}\label{sec:procmethcall} 

Procedure methods are defined in exactly the same way as a procedure is defined, just inside the hosting class.
They may return an arbitrary number of return values, and are thus only callable as a statement.
They are allowed to manipulate the graph and esp. the element they are contained in as needed, while being executed;
so you are free to call other procedures -- but in contrast to global procedures, you cannot include exec statements.

\begin{rail} 
  ProcedureMethodDefinition: ProcedureDefinition;
\end{rail}\ixnterm{ProcedureMethodDefinition}

\begin{rail}
  ProcedureMethodCall: (OutputAssignment)? (Variable | Variable '.' Attribute) \\
		'.' Name '(' (Expression * ',') ')' ;
\end{rail}\ixnterm{ProcedureMethodCall}

A such defined procedure may then be called as a statement atom from anywhere in the rule language file where an attribute evaluation (/computation) is required; or even from the sequence computations where a statement is required.
The built-in procedure methods listed in \ref{procmethstab} are called with the same syntax.

Inside the procedure method, the special entity \texttt{this} is available.
It allows to access the attributes and methods of the type the method is contained in.
In contrast to Java, C++, or C\# where \texttt{this} may be used optionally to denote member or method access,
the usage of \texttt{this} is mandatory in \GrG~in order to access the attributes of the type or call the methods of the type.

\label{procmethstab}
\end{table}


\begin{example}
In the following listing, we declare function and a procedure methods inside a node class, and use them from a rule.
Please note the mandatory \texttt{this} in the methods to denote members and call other methods.
	\begin{grgen}
node class N
{
	i:int;
	
	function get_i():int
	{
		return(this.i);
	}
	procedure set_i(var val:int)
	{
		this.i = val;
		return;
	}
	procedure inc_i(var val:int) : (int)
	{
		this.set_i( this.get_i() + val );
		return(this.i);
	}
}

rule foo : (int)
{
	n:N;
	modify {
		def var i:int;
		eval {
			n.set_i(41);
			n.inc_i(1);
			yield i = n.get_i();
		}
		return(i); // exeuting foo will return 42
	}
}
	\end{grgen}
\end{example}


\begin{example}
The following listing highlights the effect of dynamic dispatch (the heart and soul of object-oriented programming): 
the method finally called depends not simply on the static type we know for sure the object is an instance of,
but on the real dynamic type of the object, that it was created with.
Please note that in reality you use this language device to achieve the \emph{same behaviour} at the outside for objects of different types, but implemented \emph{internally consistent} regarding the exact type, taking all of its members into account (including the ones unknown to parent types).
	\begin{grgen}
node class N
{	
	function get():int
	{
		return(0);
	}
}

node class NN extends N
{	
	function get():int
	{
		return(1);
	}
}

rule foo : (int)
{
	n:N; // statically declared N, may match dynamically to node of type NN
	modify {
		def var i:int;
		eval {
			yield i = n.get();
		}
		return(i); // exeuting foo will return 0 iff n was bound to node of type N, but 1 iff n was bound to node of type NN
	}
}
	\end{grgen}
\end{example}

\section{Packages}\label{sec:packages}

Packages allow you to separate a project into namespaces that shield their content from name clashes when getting used (for models) or included (for actions) together.
They incur some non-negligible notational overhead as every usage of a name from a package outside of that package \emph{must} be prefixed with the package name (in the form \verb#packagename::name#), so we recommend to use them only when needed.
This holds esp. as we expect that a typical project will be limited to an algorithmic kernel written by a single programmer who has everything under control and can thus easily prevent name clashes.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Package Definition in the Model}\label{sub:packagemodel} 

\begin{rail}
  PackageDefinitionModel: 'package' IdentDecl lbrace
	                   ((ClassDeclaration
  									 | EnumDeclaration)+)
										rbrace;
\end{rail}\ixnterm{PackageDefinitionModel}

A \indexed{package definition} in the model is similar to a model definition as such, just reduced in its content.
It consists of \emph{ClassDeclaration}s, defining node or edge types, or \emph{EnumDeclaration}s defining enum types.
The \emph{AdvancedModelDeclarations} allowed in the root model are \emph{not} available inside a package, \emph{neither} can other models be included inside a package with \texttt{using}.
Package definitions \emph{cannot} be nested.

\begin{rail}
  PackageUsageModel: Ident '::' Ident;
\end{rail}\ixnterm{PackageUsageModel}

In every context where a node, edge, or enum type can be referenced,
by noting down its declared identifier, 
also a type from a package can be referenced,
by noting down its package as a prefix.
The package prefix may be omitted inside the package for other entities from the same package.
But only for them, outside of that package you must always use the package prefixed form for referencing identifiers from the package.

\begin{example}
Types from a model defined like this:
	\begin{grgen}
package Foo {
	node class N {
		attr : Lol;
	}
	enum Lol {
		Bla,
		Blub
	}
}

package Bar {
	node class N {
		attr : Foo::Lol;
	}	
}
	\end{grgen}
Can be used like this:
	\begin{grgen}
rule r(var inp : Foo::Lol) {
	x : Foo::N --> y : Bar::N;
	if{ x.attr==Foo::Lol::Bla; }

	modify {
		eval{ add(Foo::N); }
		eval{ y.attr = Foo::Lol::Blub; }
	}
}	
	\end{grgen}
\end{example}
	
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Package Definition in the Actions}\label{sub:packageaction} 

\begin{rail}
  PackageDefinitionAction: 'package' IdentDecl lbrace ((ActionDeclaration | SubpatternDeclaration | RewriteSequenceDefinition | FunctionDefinition | ProcedureDefinition | FilterFunctionDefinition)+) rbrace;
\end{rail}\ixnterm{PackageDefinitionAction}

A \indexed{package definition} in the actions is similar to a rule set definition as such, just reduced in its content.
It consists of \emph{ActionDeclaration}s, defining rules and tests, or \emph{SubpatternDeclaration}s to be used from the actions, or \emph{FilterFunctionDefinition}s, for filtering the matches of the actions.
It furthermore consists of \emph{FunctionDefinition}s and \emph{ProcedureDefinition}s, or \emph{RewriteSequenceDefinition}s. 
The file header constructs for using models, including other actions, or declaring global variables are \emph{not} available inside a package.
\emph{Neither} can package definitions be nested.

The packages \texttt{Math}, \texttt{File}, \texttt{Time}, \texttt{Transaction}, and \texttt{Debug} are built-in, their functions and procedures can be used directly (see \ref{sec:primexpr}, \ref{sec:subgraphop}, \ref{sub:transaction} and \ref{secdebuggersubrule} for their content).

\begin{rail}
  PackageUsageActions: Ident '::' Ident;
\end{rail}\ixnterm{PackageUsageActions}

In every context where a rule, a test, a subpattern type, a filter function, a function, a procedure, or a sequence can be referenced, by noting down its declared identifier, 
also an entity from a package can be referenced,
by noting down its package as a prefix.
The package prefix may be omitted inside the package for other entities from the same package.
But only for them, outside that package you must always use the package prefixed form for referencing identifiers from the package.

The packages in the actions are declared with the same syntax as the packages in the model, but are otherwise separate. 
You cannot extend a model package with an actions package, or vice versa.
A package with a given name can only be tied once, either in the model or the actions.

\begin{example}
The example highlights how action packages can be used.
	\begin{grgen}
package Foo {
	pattern P {
		x:Node -e:Edge-> x;

		modify {
			delete(e);
		}
	}
	
	rule r {
		p:P();

		modify {
			p();
			eval { Bar::proc(true); }
		}
	}
	
	filter f<r> {
		return;
	}
}

package Bar {
	rule r {
		x:Node -e:Edge-> x;
		if{ func(); }

		modify {
			delete(e);
			exec(Foo::r\Foo::f);
		}
	} \ auto
		
	function func : boolean {
		return(true);
	}
	
	procedure proc(var b:boolean) {
		return;
	}	
}

rule r2 {
	if{ Bar::func(); }
	p:Foo::P();
	
	modify {
		p();
	}
}

sequence s2 {
	Foo::r()\Foo::f ;> Bar::r\auto ;> { Bar::proc(Bar::func()); }
}
	\end{grgen}
\end{example}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Graph Nesting}\label{sec:graphnesting}

You can nest graphs by defining attributes of graph type (cf. \ref{cha:graph}) inside node or edge classes (cf. \ref{chapmodellang}) at modelling time, 
filling them at runtime with assignments of values of graph type, created with the operations introduced in \ref{sec:subgraphop}.
Thus, in contrast to certain modellings identifying nested graphs with nodes, a host graph contains further graphs in the \emph{attributes} of its nodes or edges.

Values of graph type are opaque and inaccessible to the computations that are available in -- and automatically apply to -- the host graph; 
from the outside, they can only be compared, i.e. isomorphy checked against other graphs
(a feature needed for state space enumeration (cf. \ref{sec:statespaceenum}), in this case only immutable subgraphs are stored).

\begin{rail} 
  ExtendedControl: 
    'in' (GraphVariable | NodeOrEdge '.' Attribute) lbrace RewriteSequence rbrace;
\end{rail}\ixkeyw{in}

But they can be opened up by switching the location of processing with the \verb#in g { seq }# sequence.
Inside the braces, the host graph is switched to \texttt{g}, the sequence \texttt{seq} is executed in that new host graph, all queries and updates are carried out on it. 
After executing the construct, the old graph that was previously used is made the current host graph again.

Switching the location of processing is a feature only available in the sequences, (re)defining the execution context for the rules; it is not available on lower levels, it is esp. not possible to access multiple graphs from within a single rule (a rule application is always carried out on a single by-then current host graph).

\begin{rail}
  Rule: GraphVariable '.' RuleIdent (() | '(' (Variable+',') ')');
\end{rail}\ixnterm{Rule}

A simplified and more lightweight version of the full switch just introduced is available for single rule calls with syntax \verb#g.r#; so a method call in the plain sequences (above the sequence computations) denotes in fact a temporary subgraph switch.
This is syntactic sugar for the dedicated switch containing only a single rule application as sequence.
The syntax of rule application is extended by the grammar rule above to allow for this is.

The \emph{information hiding} shown by the graph attributes is comparable to the information hiding shown by the objects in \emph{object-oriented programming}, there the attributes but especially the neighbouring elements are only known to the containing object and accessible to the methods of the object.
In \emph{graph-oriented programming} are the attributes but especially the neighboring elements known to the containing graph, the connecting topology is open for \emph{pattern matching}.
This crucial difference also defines the main benefit compared to OO, removing it would mean to revert back to OO.
But this openness might not be needed always for all parts.
When building a \emph{large system}, you typically only need a certain \emph{layer} to be accessible at a time.
You may use graph attributes and nested graph in this case,
utilizing open graph-oriented programming for the parts you need to work globally with pattern matching at a time,
and closed object-oriented programming for parts you only need to access locally,
decoupled by explicit move-to-subgraph and return-to-subgraph steps.

You may model containment with edges denoting a containment type pointing to the contained parts instead of attributes of subgraph type
when the pattern matcher needs overall access to the graph, but there are still some containment or nesting relationships in place.
You can then still benefit from a hierarchical structure in debugging, utilizing the built-in nesting for visualization capabilities of \GrG (cf. \ref{sub:visual}, the graphs nested in attributes are truly opaque and invisible, only when processing switches to them are they displayed instead of their containing host graph).
