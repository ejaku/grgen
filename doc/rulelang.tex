\chapter{Rule Set Language}\indexmain{rule set language}
\label{chaprulelang}

The \indexed{rule set} language forms the core of \GrG. Rule files refer to zero\footnote{Omitting a graph meta model means that \GrG\ uses a \indexed{default graph model}. The default model consists of the base type \texttt{Node} for vertices and the base type \texttt{Edge} for edges.} or more \indexed{graph model}s and specify a set of rewrite rules. The rule language covers the pattern specification and the replace/modify specification. Attributes of graph elements can be re-evaluated during an application of a rule. The following rewrite rule mentioned in Geiß et al.~\cite{GBGHS:06} gives a rough picture of the language:
%\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{example}\label{ex:rule:SomeRule}
\begin{grgen}
using SomeModel;

rule SomeRule {
  n1:NodeTypeA;
  n2:NodeTypeA;
  hom(n1, n2);
  n1 --> n2; /*@\label{ex:somerule:graphlet}@*/
  n3:NodeTypeB;
  negative {
    n3 -e1:EdgeTypeA-> n1;
    if {n3.a1 == 42*n2.a1;}
  }
  negative { /*@\label{ex:somerule:secondnac:begin}@*/
    n4:Node\(NodeTypeB);
    n3 -e1:EdgeTypeB-> n4;
    if {typeof(e1) >= EdgeTypeA;}
  } /*@\label{ex:somerule:secondnac:end}@*/
  replace {
    n5:NodeTypeC<n1>;
    n3 -e1:EdgeTypeB-> n5;
    eval {n5.a3 = n3.a1*n1.a2;}
  }  
}
\end{grgen}
\end{example}
%\end{figure}
In this chapter we use excerpts of Example~\ref{ex:rule:SomeRule} (\texttt{SomeRule}) for illustration purposes.
The nested negative which specify a pattern which must not be available in the host graph are described in the following Chapter~\ref{cha:nestedsub}

\section{Building Blocks}
\label{rulebb}

The \GrG\ rule set language is \indexed{case sensitive}. The language makes use of several identifier specializations in order to denominate all the \GrG\ entities.\\
\\
\emph{Ident}, \emph{IdentDecl}\\ \indexmain{identifier}\nopagebreak
A non-empty character sequence of arbitrary length consisting of letters, digits, or underscores. The first character must not be a digit.
\emph{Ident} may be an identifier defined in a graph model (see Section~\ref{modelbb}).
\emph{Ident} and \emph{IdentDecl} differ in their role: While \emph{IdentDecl} is a \emph{defining} occurrence of an identifier, \emph{Ident} is a \emph{using} occurrence.
An \emph{IdentDecl} non-terminal can be annotated\indexmain{annotation}. See Section~\ref{annotations} for annotations of declarations.
\begin{note}
  As in the \GrG\ model language (see note~\ref{note:modeldecl}) every declaration is also a definition. Using an identifier before defining it is allowed. Every used identifier has to be defined exactly once.
\end{note}
\mbox{ }\\
\emph{ModelIdent}, \emph{TypeIdent}, \emph{NodeType}, \emph{EdgeType}\\
These are (semantic) specializations of \emph{Ident}.
\emph{TypeIdent} matches every type identifier, i.e.\ a node type, an edge type, an enumeration type or a primitive type.
All the type identifiers are actually type \emph{expressions}\indexmain{type expression}.
See Section~\ref{typeexpressions} for the use of type expressions.\\

\subsection{Graphlets}
\label{sct:graphlets}
\begin{rail}
  Graphlet: (GraphletNode (() | Continuation) | Continuation) ';' ;
  Continuation: GraphletEdge (() | (GraphletNode (() | Continuation))) ;
\end{rail}\ixnterm{Graphlet}\ixnterm{Continuation}
A \indexed{graphlet} specifies a connected subgraph. 
\GrG\ provides graphlets as a descriptive notation to define both, patterns\indexmain{pattern graph} to search for as well as the subgraphs that replace or modify matched \indexed{spot}s in a host graph\indexmain{replacement graph}. 
Any graph can be specified piecewise by a set of graphlets. 
In Example~\ref{ex:rule:SomeRule}, line~\ref{ex:somerule:graphlet}, the statement \texttt{n1 --> n2} is the node identifier \texttt{n1} followed by the \indexedsee{continuation}{graphlet} graphlet \texttt{--> n2}.

All the graph elements of a graphlet have \newterm{name}s.
The name is either user-assigned or a unique internal, non-accessible name.
In the second case the graph element is called \newterm{anonymous}.
For illustration purposes we use a \indexed{\texttt{\$<number>}} notation to denote anonymous graph elements in this document.
For example the graphlet \texttt{n1 --> n2} contains an anonymous edge; thus can be understood as \texttt{n1 -\$1:Edge-> n2}.
Names must not be \indexed{redefine}d; once defined, a name is \emph{bound} to a graph element. 
We use the term ``\indexed{binding of names}'' because a name not only denotes a graph element of a graphlet but also denotes the mapping of the abstract graph element of a graphlet to a concrete graph element of a host graph.
So graph elements of different names are pair wise distinct except for homomorphically matched\indexmain{homomorphic matching} graph elements (see Section~\ref{patternpart}).
For instance \texttt{v:NodeType1 -e:EdgeType-> w:NodeType2} selects some node of type \texttt{Node\-Type1} that is connected to a node of type \texttt{NodeType2} by an edge of type \texttt{EdgeType} and binds the names \texttt{v}, \texttt{w}, and \texttt{e}. 
If \texttt{v} and \texttt{w} are not explicitly marked as homomorphic, the graph elements they bind to are distinct.
Binding of names allows for splitting a single graphlet into multiple graphlets as well as defining cyclic structures.
\begin{example}
The following graphlet (\texttt{n1}, \texttt{n2}, and \texttt{n3} are defined somewhere else)
\begin{grgen}
n1 --> n2 --> n3 <-- n1;
\end{grgen}
is equivalent to
\begin{grgen}
n2 --> n3;
n1 --> n2;
n3 <-- n1;
\end{grgen}
and \texttt{n1 --> n3} is equivalent to \texttt{n3 <-- n1}, of course.
\end{example}
The visibility of names is determined by \indexed{scope}s. 
Scopes can be nested. 
Names of surrounding scopes are visible in inner scopes. 
Usually a scope is defined by \texttt{\{} and \texttt{\}}. %In contrast to pure syntactic scoping, the replace/modify part is a direct inner scope of the pattern part.
In Example~\ref{ex:rule:SomeRule}, lines~\ref{ex:somerule:secondnac:begin}~to~\ref{ex:somerule:secondnac:end}, the negative condition uses \texttt{n3} from the surrounding scope and defines \texttt{n4} and \texttt{e1}. 
We may safely reuse the variable name \texttt{e1} in the replace part.

\begin{rail}
GraphletNode: (Ident | 
    '.' |
    (() | IdentDecl) ':' NodeType (() | TypeConstraint | Retyping)) ;   
\end{rail}\ixnterm{GraphletNode}
Specifies a node\indexmain{node (graphlet)} of type \emph{NodeType},
maybe constrained in type with a \emph{TypeConstraint}\indexmain{type constraint} (see Section~\ref{sec:typeconstr}, \emph{TypeConstraint}),
maybe retyped with a \emph{Reytping}\indexmain{retype} (see Section~\ref{sec:retype}, \emph{Retyping}).
The \texttt{.}\ is an anonymous node of the base type \texttt{Node}; remember that every node type has \texttt{Node} as super type. 
Type constraints are allowed in the pattern part only. 
Retyping is allowed in the replace/modify part only.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lX}
    \textbf{Graphlet} & \textbf{Meaning}\\ \hline
    \texttt{x:NodeType;} & The name \texttt{x} is bound to a node of type \texttt{NodeType} or one of its subtypes. \\
    \texttt{ :NodeType;} & \texttt{\$1:NodeType} \\
    \texttt{.;} & \texttt{\$1:Node} \\
    \texttt{x;} & The node, \texttt{x} is bound to.
  \end{tabularx}
\end{center} 

\begin{rail}
  GraphletEdge: '-' EdgeRefinement '->'  | '<-' EdgeRefinement '-'  | '<-' EdgeRefinement '->' | '?-' EdgeRefinement '-?' ;
  EdgeRefinement: () | Ident | (() | IdentDecl) ':' EdgeType (() | TypeConstraint | Retyping) ;
\end{rail}\ixnterm{GraphletEdge}\ixnterm{EdgeRefinement}
A \emph{GraphletEdge} specifies an edge\indexmain{edge (graphlet)}. 
Anonymous edges are specified by an empty \emph{EdgeRefinement} clause, i.\,e.\ \texttt{-->}, \texttt{<--}, \texttt{<-->}, \texttt{--}, \texttt{?--?} or \texttt{-:T->}, \texttt{<-:T-}, \dots\ for an edge type \texttt{T}, respectively. 
A non-empty \emph{EdgeRefinement} clause allows for detailed edge type specification. 
Type constraints\indexmain{type constraint} are allowed in the pattern part only (see Section~\ref{sec:typeconstr}, \emph{TypeConstraint}).
Retyping is allowed in the replace/modify part only (see Section~\ref{sec:retype}, \emph{Retyping}).

The different kind of arrow tips distinguish between \indexed{directed}, \indexed{undirected}, and \indexed{arbitrary} edges (see also Section~\ref{sct:basetypes}).
The arrows \texttt{-->} and \texttt{<--} are used for directed edges with a defined source and target.
The arrow \texttt{--} is used for undirected edges.
The pattern part allows for further arrow tips, namely \texttt{?--?}\ for arbitrary edges and \texttt{<-->} for directed edges with undefined direction.
Note that \texttt{<-->} is \emph{not} equivalent to the \texttt{--> ; <-- ;} statements.
In order to produce a match for the arrow \texttt{<-->}, it is sufficient that one of the statements \texttt{-->}, \texttt{<--} matches.
If an edge type is specified (through the \emph{EdgeRefinement} clause), this type has to correspond to the arrow tips, of course.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lX}
		\textbf{Graphlet} & \textbf{Meaning}\\ \hline
		\texttt{ -e:EdgeType-> ;} & The name \texttt{e} is bound to an edge of type \texttt{EdgeType} or one of its subtypes. \\
		\texttt{ -:EdgeType-> ;} & \texttt{-\$1:EdgeType-> ;} \\
		\texttt{ --> ;} & \texttt{-\$1:Edge-> ;} \\
		\texttt{ <--> ;} & \texttt{-\$1:Edge-> ;} or  \texttt{<-\$1:Edge- ;}\\
		\texttt{ -- ;} & \texttt{-\$1:UEdge-> ;} \\
		\texttt{ ?--?\ ;} & \texttt{-\$1:AEdge-> ;} \\
		\texttt{ -e-> ;} & The edge, \texttt{e} is bound to.
	\end{tabularx}
\end{center} 
As the above table shows, edges can be defined and used separately, i.e.\ without their incident nodes. Beware of accidentally ``\indexed{redirecting}''\footnote{You cannot directly express the redirection of edges. This a direct consequence of the \indexedsee{SPO}{single-pushout approach}\indexmain{single-pushout approach} approach. Redirection of edges can be ``simulated'' by either deleting and re-inserting an edge, or more indirect by re-typing of nodes.} an edge: 
The graphlets
\begin{grgenlet}
-e:Edge-> .;
x:Node -e-> y:Node;
\end{grgenlet}
are illegal, because the edge \texttt{e} would have two destinations: an anonymous node and \texttt{y}.
However, the graphlets
\begin{grgenlet}
-e-> ;
x:Node -e:Edge-> y:Node;
\end{grgenlet}
are allowed, but the first graphlet \texttt{-e->} is superfluous. In particular this graphlet does not identify or create any ``copies'', neither if the graphlet occurs in the pattern part nor if it occurs in the replace part.
\begin{example}
Some attempts to specify a loop edge:\\
\mbox{ }\\
\begin{tabular}[c]{ll} 
 \textbf{Graphlet} & \textbf{Meaning} \\ \hline
 \texttt{x:Node -e:Edge-> x;} & The edge \texttt{e} is a loop.\\ 
 \texttt{x:Node -e:Edge-> ; -e-> x;} & The edge \texttt{e} is a loop.\\ 
 \texttt{-e:Edge-> x:Node;} & The edge \texttt{e} may or may not be a loop.\\ 
 \texttt{.\ -e:Edge-> .;} & The edge \texttt{e} is certainly not a loop.\\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{example}

\section{Rules and Tests}
\label{ruledecls}
The structure of a \indexed{rule set} file is as follows:
\begin{rail}
  RuleSet: FileHeader ((TestDeclaration | RuleDeclaration | SubpatternDeclaration)+) ;
  FileHeader: ('using' ((ModelIdent)+',') ';')? (('\#include' Filename)*());
\end{rail}\ixkeyw{using}\ixkeyw{include}\ixnterm{RuleSet}\ixnterm{FileHeader}

A rule set consists of the underlying \indexed{graph model}s and several rewrite rules and tests (subpatterns will be introduced in \ref{sec:subpattern}).
Additionally you may include further rule set files (without \texttt{using} directives, we prefer to suffix them with \texttt{.gri} in this case).
In case of multiple graph models, \GrG\ uses the union of these models. In this case beware of conflicting declarations.
There is no built-in conflict resolution mechanism like packages or namespaces for models.
If necessary you can use prefixes as you might do in C.

\begin{rail}
  TestDeclaration: (() | 'exact' | 'induced') 'test' ActionSignature lbrace Pattern rbrace ;
  RuleDeclaration: (() | 'exact' | 'induced' | 'dpo' | 'dangling' | 'identification' ) 'rule' ActionSignature lbrace Pattern Replace rbrace ;
\end{rail}\ixkeyw{test}\ixkeyw{rule}\ixkeyw{exact}\ixkeyw{induced}\ixkeyw{dpo}\ixkeyw{dangling}\ixkeyw{identification}\ixnterm{TestDeclaration}\ixnterm{RuleDeclaration}
Declares a single \indexed{rewrite rule} such as \texttt{SomeRule}. 
It consists of a pattern part (see Section~\ref{patternpart}) in conjunction with its rewrite/modify part (see Section~\ref{sec:replacemodify}). 
A \newterm{test} has no rewrite specification. 
It's intended to check whether (and maybe how many times) a pattern occurs (see example \ref{ex:rulelang:testrule}).
For an explanation of the \texttt{exact}, \texttt{induced}, \texttt{dangling}, \texttt{identification}, and \texttt{dpo} pattern modifiers see Section~\ref{sct:patternmodifier}. 
\begin{example}
\label{ex:rulelang:testrule}
We define a test \texttt{SomeCond}
\begin{grgen}
test SomeCond {
  n:SeldomNodeType;
}
\end{grgen}
and execute in \GrShell:
\begin{grshell}
  grs SomeCond & SomeRule
\end{grshell}
SomeRule will only be executed, if a node of type \texttt{SeldomNodeType} exists. 
For graph rewrite sequences in \GrShell\ see Section~\ref{grsthings}.
\end{example}

\begin{rail}  
  ActionSignature: IdentDecl (() | Parameters) (() | ':' ReturnTypes) ;
\end{rail}\ixnterm{ActionSignature}
The \indexed{signature} sets the name of a rewrite rule to \emph{IdentDecl} and optionally names and types of formal \indexed{parameter}s as well as a list of \indexed{return type}s.
Parameters and return types provide users with the ability to exchange graph elements between rules, similar to parameters of procedural languages.
This way it is possible to specify \emph{where} a rule should be applied.

\begin{rail}
  Parameters: '(' (Parameter * ',') ')' ;
  Parameter: IdentDecl ':' NodeType (InputTypeSpecification)? | '-' IdentDecl ':' EdgeType (InputTypeSpecification)? '->' | 'var' IdentDecl ':' VarType ;
  InputTypeSpecification: '<' (NodeEdgeType | 'null' | NodeEdgeType '+' 'null' | 'null' '+' NodeEdgeType ) '>' ;
\end{rail}\ixnterm{Parameter}\ixnterm{InputTypeSpecification}\ixkeyw{null}\ixkeyw{var}

Within a rule, graph element parameters are treated as graph elements of the pattern - just predefined.
But in contrast to pervious versions it is the task of the user to ensure the elements handed in satisfy the interface, i.e. parameters must not be null and must be of the type specified or a subtype of the type specified. 
If you need more flexibility and want to call the rule with parameters not fullfilling the interface you can append an input type specification to the relevant parameters, which consists of the type to accept at the action interface, or null, or both, enclosed in left and right angles. 
If the input type specification type is given, but the more specific pattern element type is not satisfied, matching simply fails.
If null is declared in the input type specification and given at runtime, the element is searched in the host graph.
Don't use null parameters unless you need them, because every null parameter doubles the number of matcher routines which get generated.
Non-graph element parameters must be prefixed by the \texttt{var}-keyword, VarType is one of the attribute types supported by \GrG\ (\ref{sec:builtintypes}).
Please note that the effect of assigning to a var parameter in \texttt{eval} (see \ref{sec:replacemodify}) is undefined (concerning the parameters as well as the argument).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{example}
The \indexed{test} \texttt{t} that checks whether node \texttt{n1} is \indexed{adjacent} to \texttt{n2} (connected by an undirected edge or incoming directed edge or outgoing directed edge)
\begin{grgen}
test t(n1:Node<null>, n2:Node<null>) {
  n1 ?--? n2;
}
\end{grgen}
is equivalent to the tests \texttt{t1}-\texttt{t4} which are chosen dependent on what parameters are defined.
\begin{grgen}
test t1(n1:Node, n2:Node) {
  n1 ?--? n2;
}
test t2(n1:Node) {
  n1 ?--? n2:Node;
}
test t3(n2:Node) {
  n1:Node ?--? n2;
}
test t4 {
  n1:Node ?--? n2:Node;
}
\end{grgen}
So if both parameters are not defined, \texttt{t4} is chosen, which succeeds as soon as there are two distinct nodes in the graph connected by some edge.
\end{example}
\end{figure}

\begin{rail}
  ReturnTypes: '(' ((NodeType | EdgeType | VarType) + ',') ')' ;
\end{rail}\ixnterm{ReturnTypes}
The return types specify edge and node types of graph elements that are returned by the replace/modify part.
If return types are specified, the \texttt{return} statement is mandatory.
Otherwise no \texttt{return} statement must occur. See also Section~\ref{sec:replacemodify}, \texttt{return}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{example}\label{ex:rule:someruleext}
We extend \texttt{SomeRule} (Example~\ref{ex:rule:SomeRule}) with a user defined node to match and we want it to return the rewritten graph elements \texttt{n5} and \texttt{e1}.
\begin{grgen}
  rule SomeRuleExt(varnode:Node):(Node, EdgeTypeB) {
    n1:NodeTypeA;
    ...
    
    replace {
      varnode;
      ...  
      return(n5, e1);
      eval {
        ...
\end{grgen}
We do not define \texttt{varnode} within the pattern part because this is already covered by the parameter specification itself.
\end{example}
\end{figure}

\section{Pattern Part}\indexmain{pattern}
\label{patternpart}
%\begin{rail}
%  Pattern: (() + ('exact' | 'induced')) 'pattern' lbrace (()+PatternStatement) rbrace ;
%\end{rail}\ixkeyw{pattern}\ixkeyw{induced}\ixnterm{Pattern}
\begin{rail}
  Pattern: (()+PatternStatement) (() | ReturnStatement);
\end{rail}\ixnterm{Pattern}
A \indexed{pattern} consists of zero or more pattern statements and, in case of a test, an optional return statement.
All the pattern statements must be fulfilled by a subgraph of the host graph in order to form a match. 
An \indexed{empty pattern} always produces exactly one (empty) match. 
This is caused by the uniqueness of the total and totally undefined function.
For an explanation of the pattern modifiers \texttt{dpo}, \texttt{identification}, \texttt{dangling}, \texttt{induced}, and \texttt{exact} see Section~\ref{sct:patternmodifier}.

Names defined for graph elements may be used by other pattern statements as well as by replace/modify statements. 
Like all identifier definitions, such names may be used before their \indexed{declaration}. 
See Section~\ref{rulebb} for a detailed explanation of names and graphlets.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{note}
\label{note:indeterminism}
The \indexed{application} of a rule is not deterministic\indexmain{non-determinism}\indexmainsee{determinism}{non-determinism} (remember the example of the introduction in Section~\ref{ov:example}); in particular there may be more than one subgraph that matches the pattern. 
Whereas the \GrShell\ selects one of them arbitrarily (without further abilities to control the selection), the underlying \LibGr\indexmain{libGr} provides a mechanism to deal with such ambiguities. 

Also notice that graph rewrite \emph{sequences}\indexmain{graph rewrite sequence} introduce a further variant of non-determinism on rule application level: 
The \indexed{\texttt{\$<op>}} flag marks the operator \texttt{<op>} as commutative, i.e.\ the execution order of its operands (rules) is non-deterministic. 
See Chapter~\ref{cha:xgrs} for further information on graph rewrite sequences.

The semantics of the various pattern statements are given below:
\begin{description}
  \item[Graphlet] \indexmain{graphlet}Graphlets specify connected subgraphs. See Section~\ref{rulebb} for a detailed explanation of graphlets.
  \item[Isomorphic/Homomorphic Matching] \indexmain{isomorphic matching}\indexmain{homomorphic matching}The \texttt{hom} operator specifies the nodes or edges that may be matched homomorphically. 
  In contrast to the default isomorphic matching, the specified graph elements \emph{may} be mapped to the same graph element in the host graph. Note that the graph elements must have a common subtype. 
  Several homomorphically matched graph elements will be mapped to a graph element of a common subtype.
  In Example~\ref{ex:rule:SomeRule} nodes \texttt{n1} and \texttt{n2} may be the same node. This is possible because they are of the same type (\texttt{NodeTypeA}).
  Inside a NAC the \texttt{hom} operator may only operate on graph elements that are either defined or used in the NAC.
  Nested \texttt{negative}/\texttt{independent} blocks inherit the \texttt{hom} declarations of their nesting pattern.
  In contrast to previous versions \texttt{hom} delarations are non-transitive, i.e \texttt{hom(a,b)} and \texttt{hom(b,c)} don't cause \texttt{hom(a,c)} unless specified.
  \item[Attribute Conditions] \indexmain{attribute condition}The Java-like attribute conditions (keyword \texttt{if}) in the pattern part allow for further restriction of the applicability of a rule.
  \item[Pattern Modifiers] Additionally to modifiers that apply to a pattern as a whole, you may also specify pattern modifiers for a specific set of nodes. Accordingly the list of identifiers for a pattern modifier must not contain any edge identifier. See Section~\ref{sct:patternmodifier} for an explanation of the \texttt{exact} and \texttt{induced} modifiers. 
  \item[NestedPattern] will be explained in \ref{nac},\ref{pac},\ref{cardinality},\ref{alternative}.
  \item[SubpatternEntityDeclaration] will be explained in \ref{sec:subpattern}.
\end{description}

Keep in mind that using type constraints or the \texttt{typeof} operator might be helpful. See Section~\ref{typeexpressions} for further information.


\begin{rail}
  ReturnStatement: 'return' '(' ((Ident|Expression)+',') ')' ';' ;
\end{rail}\ixkeyw{return}\ixnterm{ReturnStatement}
\indexmain{return value}Returned graph elements (given by their name) and value entities (given by an expression computing them) must appear in the same order as defined by the return types in the signature (see Section~\ref{ruledecls}, \texttt{ActionSignature}).
Their types must be compatible to the return types specified.

\begin{note}
If you are using a graph at the API level without shell-provided names accessible by the \texttt{nameof}-operator, you may want to number the graph elements for dumping like this:
\begin{grgen}
rule numberNode(var id:int) : (int)
{
  n:NodeWithIntId;
  if { n.id == 0; }
  
  modify {
    eval {
      n.id = id;
    }
    return (id + 1);
  }
}
\end{grgen}
\end{note} 


\section{Replace/Modify Part}\indexmain{replacement graph}
\label{sec:replacemodify}
Besides specifying the pattern, a main task of a rule is to specify the transformation of a matched subgraph within the \indexed{host graph}. 
Such a \indexed{transformation specification} defines the transition from the \indexed{left hand side} (LHS) to the \indexed{right hand side} (RHS), i.e.\ which graph elements of a match will be kept, which of them will be deleted and which graph elements have to be newly created.

\subsection{Implicit Definition of the Preservation Morphism\indexmain{preservation morphism} $r$}
\label{rule:morphismr}
In theory the transformation specification is done by defining the preservation morphism $r$.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{scope}[minimum size=0.5cm]
      \tikzstyle{every node}=[draw]

    \end{scope}

    \draw[thick,->]  (H) -> (Hs) node[below,midway] {Rule Application};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Process of Graph Transformation}
  \label{rule:figrule}
\end{figure}
In \GrG\, the preservation morphism $r$ is defined implicitly by using \indexed{name}s both in pattern \indexed{graphlet}s and replace graphlets.
Remember that to each of the graph elements a name is bound to, either user defined or internally defined. If such a name is used in a replace graphlet, the denoted graph element will be kept. 
Otherwise the graph element will be deleted.
By defining a name in a replace graphlet a corresponding graph element will be newly created.
So in a replace pattern \indexed{anonymous} graph elements will always be created.
Using a name multiple times has the same effect as a single using occurrence.
In case of a conflict between \indexed{deletion} and \indexed{preservation}, deletion is prioritized. 
If an incident node of an edge gets deleted, the edge will be deleted as well (in compliance to the SPO\indexmain{single-pushout approach} semantics).

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lllX}
  \textbf{Pattern (LHS)} & \textbf{Replace (RHS)} & \textbf{$r: L \longrightarrow R$} & \textbf{Meaning} \\ \hline

  \texttt{x:N -e:E-> y:N;} & \texttt{x -e-> ;} & $r:\{\lhs.x\} \mapsto \{\rhs.x\}$ & Deletion of \texttt{y}. Hence del\-etion of \texttt{e}. \\
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Definition of the preservation morphism $r$}
\label{rule:impldefinition}
\end{table}



\subsection{Specification Modes for Graph Transformation}
For the task of rewriting, \GrG\ provides two different modes: A \emph{replace mode} and a \emph{modify mode}.
\begin{description}
  \item[Replace mode] \indexmain{replace mode}The semantics of this mode is to delete every graph element of the pattern that is not used (occur) in the replace part, keep every graph element that is used, and create every additionally defined graph elements. ``Using'' means that the name of a graph element occurs in a replace graphlet. Attribute calculations are no using occurrences.\\
  In Example~\ref{ex:rule:someruleext} the nodes \texttt{varnode} and \texttt{n3} will be kept. The node \texttt{n1} is replaced by the node \texttt{n5} preserving \texttt{n1}'s edges. The anonymous edge instance between \texttt{n1} and \texttt{n2} only occurs in the pattern and therefore gets deleted.\\
See Section~\ref{rule:morphismr} for a detailed explanation of the transformation semantics. 
  \item[Modify mode] The \indexed{modify mode} can be regarded as a replace part in replace mode, where every pattern graph element is added (occurs) before the first replace statement. 
In particular all the \indexed{anonymous} graph elements are kept. 
Additionally this mode supports the \texttt{delete} operator that deletes every element given as an argument. 
Deletion takes place after all other rewrite operations. Multiple deletion of the same graph element is allowed (but pointless) as well as deletion of just created elements (pointless, too).
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{example}
How might Example~\ref{ex:rule:someruleext} look in modify mode? 
We have to denominate the anonymous edge between \texttt{n1} and \texttt{n2} in order to delete it. 
The node \texttt{varnode} should be kept and does not need to appear in the modify part. 
So we have
\begin{grgen}
rule SomeRuleExtModify(varnode: Node): (Node, EdgeTypeB)  {
  ...
  n1 -e0:Edge-> n2;
  ...
  modify {
    n5:NodeTypeC<n1>;
    n3 -e1:EdgeTypeB-> n5;
    delete(e0);
    eval {
      ...
\end{grgen}
\end{example}
\end{figure}
\end{description}

\subsection{Syntax}

\begin{rail}
  Replace: ('replace' | 'modify') lbrace (()+ReplaceStatement) (() | ReturnStatement) \\
  (()+ExecStatement) rbrace ;
\end{rail}\ixkeyw{replace}\ixkeyw{modify}\ixnterm{Replace}
Selects whether the replace mode or the modify mode is used. Several replace statements describe the transformation from the pattern subgraph to the destination subgraph.

\begin{rail}  
  ReplaceStatement:
    Graphlet ';' |
    'delete' '(' (Ident + ',') ')' ';' |
    'eval' lbrace (Assignment ';' +) rbrace |
    SubpatternRewriteApplication
    ;
\end{rail}\ixkeyw{delete}\ixkeyw{eval}\ixnterm{ReplaceStatement}
The semantics of the various replace statements are given below:
\begin{description}
  \item[Graphlet] \indexmain{graphlet}Analogous to a pattern graphlet; a specification of a connected subgraph. Its graph elements are either kept because they are elements of the pattern or added otherwise. Names defined in the pattern part must not be redefined in the replace graphlet. See Section~\ref{rulebb} for a detailed explanation of graphlets. 
  \item[Deletion] \indexmain{deletion}The \texttt{delete} operator is only available in the modify mode. It deletes the specified pattern graph elements. Multiple occurrences of \texttt{delete} statements are allowed. Deletion statements are executed after all other replace statements. Multiple deletion of the same graph element is allowed (but pointless) as well as deletion of just created elements (pointless, too).
  \item[Attribute Evaluation] \indexmain{attribute evaluation}\indexmainsee{evaluation}{attribute evaluation}\indexmainsee{re-evaluation}{attribute evaluation}If a rule is applied, then the attributes of matched and inserted graph elements will be recalculated according to the \texttt{eval} statements.
  \item[SubpatternRewriteApplication] will be explained in \ref{sec:subrule}.
\end{description} 

\begin{rail}    
   Assignment: NodeOrEdge '.' Ident '=' Expression | NodeOrEdge '.' 'visited' ('[' FlagNumber ']')? '=' BoolExpr;
\end{rail}\indexmain{attribute evaluation}\ixnterm{Assignment}\ixkeyw{visited}
Several evaluation parts are allowed within the replace part. 
Multiple evaluation statements will be internally concatenated, preserving their order.
Evaluation statements have \indexedsee{imperative}{attribute evaluation} semantics.
In particular, \GrG\ does not care about data dependencies.
Evaluation takes place before any graph element gets deleted and after all the new elements have been created.
You may read (and write, although this is pointless) attributes of graph elements to be deleted.
Assignment is carried out using \indexmain{value semantics}, even for entities of \verb#set<K># and \verb#map<K,V># or \texttt{string} type.
The only exception is the type \texttt{object}, there \indexmain{reference semantics} is used.
The \texttt{visited} flag assignment sets the \texttt{boolean} status of the \indexed{visited flag} of the given number for the given graph element.
If no flag number is given, the default number for the first visited flag of 0 is used.
Make sure to allocate\ref{allocvisitflag}/\ref{apiallocvisitflag} visited flags before you try to use them 
(and deallocate them afterwards, as they are a sparse resource stored in some excess bits of the graph elements, or in some dictionary if the needed number of flags exceeds the number of available bits per graph element.)

\begin{example}
\begin{grgen}
...
modify {
  ...
  eval { y.i = 40; }
  eval { y.j = 0;  }
  x:IJNode;
  y:IJNode;
  delete(x);
  eval {
    x.i = 1; 
    y.j = x.i;
    x.i = x.i + 1;
    y.i = y.i + x.i;
  }
}
\end{grgen}
This toy example yields $\texttt{y.i} = 42$, $\texttt{y.j} = 1$.
\end{example}

\section{Rule and Pattern Modifiers}\indexmain{modifier} 
\label{sct:patternmodifier}
By default \GrG\ performs rewriting according to \indexmain{SPO} semantics as explained in Section~\ref{rule:morphismr}.
This behaviour can be changed with \newterm{pattern modifiers} and \newterm{rule modifiers}.
Such modifiers add certain conditions to the applicability of a pattern.
The idea is to match only parts of the host graph that look more or less exactly like the pattern.
The level of ``exactness'' depends on the choosen modifier.
A pattern modifier in front of the \texttt{rule}/\texttt{test}-keyword is equivalent to one modifier-statement inside the pattern containing all the specified nodes (including anonymous nodes).
Table \ref{tbl:rules:patternmodifiers} lists the pattern modifiers with their semantics, table \ref{tbl:rules:rulemodifiers} lists the rule only modifiers with their semantics.
Example \ref{ex:rules:modifiers} explains the modifiers by small toy-graphs.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{l|X}
        \bf Modifier & \bf Meaning \\\hline
        \texttt{exact} & Switches to the most restricitive mode. An exactly-matched node is matched, if all its incident edges in the host graph are specified in the pattern.\\
        \texttt{induced} & Switches to the induced-mode, where nodes contained in the same \texttt{induced} statement require their induced subgraph within the host graph to be specified, in order to be matched. In particular this means that in general \texttt{induced(a,b,c)} differs from \texttt{induced(a,b); induced(b,c)}.\\
    \end{tabularx}    
    \caption{Semantics of pattern modifiers}
    \label{tbl:rules:patternmodifiers}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{l|X}
        \bf Modifier & \bf Meaning \\\hline
        \texttt{dpo} & Switches to DPO semantics \indexmainsee{DPO}{double-pushout approach}. This modifier affects only nodes that are to be deleted during the rewrite. DPO says---roughly spoken---that implicit deletions must not occur by all means. To ensure this the dangling condition (see \texttt{dangling} below) and the identification condition (see \texttt{identification} below) get enforced (i.e. \texttt{dpo = dangling + identification}). In contrast to \texttt{exact} and \texttt{induced} this modifier applies neither to a pattern as such (can't be used with a \texttt{test}) nor to a single statement but only to an entire rule. See Corradini et al.\cite{dpoapproach} for a DPO reference.\\
		\texttt{dangling} & Ensures the dangling condition \indexmain{dangling condition}. This modifier affects only nodes that are to be deleted during the rewrite. Nodes going to be deleted due to the rewrite part have to be specified exactly (with all their incident edges, \texttt{exact} semantics) in order to be matched. As with \texttt{dpo}, this modifier applies only to rules.\\
		\texttt{identification} & Ensures the identification condition \indexmain{identification condition}. This modifier affects only nodes that are to be deleted during the rewrite. If you specify two pattern graph elements to be homomorphically matched but only one of them is subject to deletion during rewrite, those pattern graph elements will never actually be matched to the same host graph element. As with \texttt{dpo}, this modifier applies only to rules.\\
    \end{tabularx}    
    \caption{Semantics of rule only modifiers}
    \label{tbl:rules:rulemodifiers}
\end{table}

\begin{note}
    Internally all the modifier-annotated rules are resolved into equivalent rules in standard SPO semantics.
    The semantics of the modifiers is mostly implemented by NACs.
    In particular you might want to use such modifiers in order to avoid writing a bunch of NACs yourself.
    The number of internally created NACs is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(n)$ for \texttt{exact} and \texttt{dpo} and by $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ for \texttt{induced} respectively, where $n$ is the number of specified nodes.

\section{Static Type Constraint}
\label{sec:typeconstr}
Node/edge declaration with type constraint.

\begin{rail}
  TypeConstraint: backslash ( '(' (TypeExpr + '+')  ')' | TypeExpr ); 
\end{rail}\ixnterm{TypeConstraint}
A \indexed{type constraint} is used to exclude parts of the \indexed{type hierarchy}. The operator \texttt{+} is used to create a union of its operand types. So the following pattern statements are identical:\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[c]{|ll|ll|}\hline
\begin{tabular}{l}\texttt{x:T \char"5C\ (T1 + $\cdots$ + T$n$);}\\\end{tabular} &&& 
  \begin{tabular}{l}\texttt{x:T;} \\ \texttt{if \{!(\emph{typeof}(x) >= T1) \&\& $\cdots$} \\ \texttt{\ \ \ \ \&\& !(\emph{typeof}(x) >= T$n$)\}}\\\end{tabular} \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{example}

  \parbox{\linewidth}{The type constraint \texttt{T\char"5C (T2+T3)} applied to the type hierarchy on the left side yields only the types \texttt{T} and \texttt{T1} as valid.}
\end{tabularx}
\end{example}


\section{Exact Dynamic Type}\indexmainsee{exact dynamic type}{dynamic type}\indexmain{dynamic type}

\begin{rail}
  Type: TypeIdent | 'typeof' '(' NodeOrEdge ')' ;
\end{rail}\ixkeyw{typeof}\ixnterm{Type}
The type of a graph element may be given by a type identifier,
or a typeof denoting the exact dynamic type of a matched graph element.
The element declaration \texttt{el:typeof(x)} introduces a graph element of the type the host graph element \texttt{x} is actually bound to.
\begin{example}
The following rule will add a reverse edge to a one-way street.
\begin{grgen}
rule oneway {
    a:Node -x:street-> y:Node;
    negative {
        y -:typeof(x)-> a;
    }
    replace {
        a -x-> y;
        y -:typeof(x)-> a;
    }
}
\end{grgen}
Remember that we have several subtypes of \texttt{street}. By the aid of the \texttt{typeof} operator, the reverse edge will be automatically typed correctly (the same type as the one-way edge). This behavior is not possible without the \texttt{typeof} operator.
\end{example}


\section{Retyping} \label{sec:retype}
In addition to graph rewriting, \GrG\ allows graph relabeling\cite{Relabelling}, too; we prefer to call it retyping. 
Nodes as well as edges may be retyped to a different type; attributes common to the initial and final type are kept.
The target type does not need to be a subtype or supertype of the original type.
Retyping is useful for rewriting a node but keeping its incident edges; without it you'd need to remember and restore those.
Syntacically it is specified by giving the original node enclosed in left and right angles.
\begin{rail}
  Retyping: '<' Ident '>';
\end{rail}\ixnterm{Retyping}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lllX}
  \textbf{Pattern (LHS)} & \textbf{Replace (RHS)} & \textbf{$r: L \longrightarrow R$} & \textbf{Meaning} \\ \hline 
  \texttt{x:N1;} & \texttt{y:N2<x>;}          & $r:\lhs.x \mapsto \rhs.x$ & Preserve \texttt{x}, then retype \texttt{x} from \texttt{N1} to \texttt{N2} and bind name \texttt{y} to retyped version of \texttt{x}.\\
  \texttt{e:E1;} & \texttt{f:E2<e>;}          & $r:\lhs.e \mapsto \rhs.e$ & Preserve \texttt{e}, then retype \texttt{e} from \texttt{E1} to \texttt{E2} and bind name \texttt{f} to the retyped version of \texttt{e}.\\
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Retyping of preserved nodes and edges}
\label{rule:retyping_graphlets}

\indexmain{retyping}Retyping enables us to keep all adjacent nodes and all attributes stemming from common super types of a graph element while changing its type (table~\ref{rule:retyping_graphlets} shows how retyping can be expressed both for nodes and edges).
Retyping differs from a \indexedsee{type cast}{retyping}: During replacement both of the graph elements are alive.
  Specifically both of them are available for evaluation, a respective evaluation could, e.g., look like this:
  \begin{grgenlet}
eval {
  y.b = ( 2*x.i == 42 );
  f.a = e.a;
}
  \end{grgenlet}
Furthermore the source and destination types need \emph{not} to be on a path in the directed \indexed{type hierarchy} graph, rather their relation can be arbitrary.
However, if source and destination type have one ore more common super types, then the respective attribute values are adopted by the retyped version of the respective node (or edge).
The edge specification as well as \emph{ReplaceNode} supports retyping. 
In Example~\ref{ex:rule:SomeRule} node \texttt{n5} is a retyped node stemming from node \texttt{n1}.
Note, that---conceptually---the retyping is performed \emph{after} the SPO conform rewrite.

\begin{example}
The following rule will promote the matched city \texttt{x} from a \texttt{City} to a \texttt{Metropolis} keeping all its incident edges/streets, 
with exception of the matched street \texttt{y}, which will get promoted from \texttt{Street} to \texttt{Highway}, keeping all its adjacent nodes/cities.
\begin{grgen}
rule oneway {
    x:City -y:Street->;
    replace {
		x_rt:Metropolies<x> -y_rt:Highway<y>->;
    }
}
\end{grgen}
\end{example}


\section{Annotations}\indexmain{annotation}
\label{annotations}

Identifier \indexed{definition}s can be annotated by \indexedsee{pragma}{annotation}s. Annotations are key-value pairs.
\begin{rail}
  IdentDecl: Ident (() | '[' (Ident '=' Constant + ',') ']');
\end{rail}\ixnterm{IdentDecl}
Although you can use any key-value pairs between the brackets, only the identifier \ixkeyw{prio} has an effect so far.
\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|lllX|} \hline
  \textbf{Key} & \textbf{Value Type} & \textbf{Applies to} & \textbf{Meaning} \\ \hline
  \texttt{prio} & int & node, edge & Changes the ranking of a graph element for \indexed{search plan}s. The default is \texttt{prio}=1000. Graph elements with high values are likely to appear prior to graph elements with low values in search plans.\\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Annotations}
\label{tabannotations}
\end{table}
\begin{example}
We search the pattern \texttt{v:NodeTypeA -e:EdgeType-> w:NodeTypeB}. We have a host graph with about 100 nodes of \texttt{NodeTypeA}, 1,000 nodes of \texttt{NodeTypeB} and 10,000 edges of \texttt{EdgeType}. Furthermore we know that between each pair of \texttt{NodeTypeA} and \texttt{NodeTypeB} there exists at most one edge of \texttt{EdgeType}. \GrG\ can use this information to improve the initial search plan if we adjust the pattern like \texttt{v[prio=10000]:NodeTypeA -e[prio=5000]:EdgeType-> w:NodeTypeB}.
\end{example}

\section{Imperative Statements}\indexmain{imperative statements} 
\label{sct:imperative}

\begin{rail}  
  ExecStatement: 'emit' '(' StringExpr ')' ';' |
    'exec' '(' RewriteSequence ')' \\ ((NodeType | '-' IdentDecl ':' EdgeType '->') * ',') ';'
\end{rail}\ixkeyw{emit}\ixkeyw{exec}\ixnterm{ExecStatement}
The statements \texttt{emit} and \texttt{exec} enhance the declarative rewrite part by imperative clauses.
That means, these statements are executed in the same order as they appear within the rule.
The execution statements take place after all the rewrite operations are done, i.e.\ they operate on the modified host graph.
However, \emph{attribute} values of deleted graph elements are still available for reading.
The \texttt{eval} statements are executed before the execution statements, i.e.\ the execution statements work on the recalculated attributes.
\begin{description}
  \item[XGRS Execution] The \texttt{exec} statement executes a graph rewrite sequence, which is a composition of graph rewrite rules. Yielded graph elements may be included into the RHS pattern, but as of now they are only available to the \texttt{return} statement. See Chapter~\ref{cha:xgrs} for a description of graph rewrite sequences.
  \item[Text Output] The \texttt{emit} statement prints a string to the currently associated output stream (default is \texttt{stdout}). See Chapter~\ref{cha:typeexpr} for a description of string expressions.
  For emitting in between the emits from subpatterns, there is an additional \texttt{emithere} statement available.
\end{description}

\begin{example}
	The following example works on a hypothetical network flow.
	We don't define all the rules nor the graph meta model.
	It's just about the look and feel of the \texttt{exec} and \texttt{emit} statements
	\begin{grgen}
rule AddRedundancy {
  s: SourceNode;
  t: DestinationNode;	
  modify {
    emit ("Source node is " + s.name + ". Destination node is " + t.name + ".");
    exec ( (x:SourceNode) = DuplicateNode(s) & ConnectNeighbors(s, x)* );
    exec ( [DuplicateCriticalEdge] );
    exec ( MaxCapacityIncidentEdge(t)* );
    emit ("Redundancy added");
  }
}  
	\end{grgen}
\end{example}
