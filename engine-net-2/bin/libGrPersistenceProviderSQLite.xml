            <summary>
            An implementation of the IPersistenceProvider that allows to persist changes to a named graph to an SQLite database
            (so a kind of named graph DAO; utilizing a package reference to the official SQLite ADO.NET driver).
            (Design idea: everything reachable from the host graph is stored in the database, in contrast to all graphs/nodes/edges/objects created at runtime, with the elements visible due to graph processing events lying in between)
