            <summary>
            A class that carries out a garbage collection of the host graph, finally removing unreachable deleted entities and compactifying containers (by overwriting event change histories by the current state).

            <summary>
            A class used in adapting the stored database model to the model of the host graph, which includes initialization of an empty database model.

        <member name="T:de.unika.ipd.grGen.libGrPersistenceProviderSQLite.PersistenceProviderSQLite">
            <summary>
            An implementation of the IPersistenceProvider that allows to persist changes to a named graph to an SQLite database
            (so a kind of named graph DAO; utilizing a package reference to the official SQLite ADO.NET driver).
            (Design idea: everything reachable from the host graph is stored in the database, in contrast to all graphs/nodes/edges/objects created at runtime, with the elements visible due to graph processing events lying in between)
            This class handles graph change events directly, storing modifications of the graph to the database, while delegating model initialization/updating, host graph reading, and host graph cleaning to appropriate task classes.
            Some database infrastructure / persistence provider helper/shared code is available in the PersistenceProviderSQLiteBase this class inherits from.
