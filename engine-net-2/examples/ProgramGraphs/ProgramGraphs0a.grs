# graph rewrite shell script file, shows how to create an empty graph from a rule file giving the rewrite rules (using the model),
# filling it with an initialization rule, validating it along the connectiong assertions
#  (strict validation - requires that every edge was covered)
# a noteworthy point is that validation needs to be requested, connection assertions are allowed to be violated during transformations
# the intersting part is the layout, graph displayed in the debugger, which is a haystack even for this small example
# next is ProgramGraphs0b.grs
